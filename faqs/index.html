              <button class="accordion">What is hackathon?</button>

                    <p>
                      A hackathon is best described as an “invention marathon”. Anyone who has an interest in technology attends a hackathon to learn, build & share their creations over the course of a weekend in a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. You don’t have to be a programmer and you certainly don’t have to be majoring in Computer Science.

                <p>
                  That’s normal. Most people don’t have an idea before they get to the event. But once you start talking to other people, you might come up with something. You can also work with somebody else on their idea if you like it. And there will be sponsors prizes at the event which might help give you some ideas. Don’t worry about it, you’ll find something to work on.                </p>
